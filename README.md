## _Scraping Project : Wine and Spirits Sales Analysis on iDealwine_

### Project Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze data related to the sales of wines and spirits from the iDealwine platform.
iDealwine is a specialized platform offering wine auctions, online sales through its e-store (e-caviste), and cellar management services. It is renowned for its extensive selection, ranging from prestigious grands crus to more accessible bottles.
### Scraping Objectives
To carry out this project, I scraped data from the "All Wines for Sale" section of iDealwine. The data includes information from the platform’s two main sales channels:
- Auctions
- E-store (e-caviste)

The scraped data covers several features of the wines and spirits, such as:
- Prices
- Wine colors (red, white, rosé, amber, etc.)
- Sales types
- etc..

### Amount of Data Collected
This scraping process resulted in a total of 24 columns and 12678 rows in a csv file, providing a comprehensive dataset for statistical analysis and market trend exploration.

### Project Goals
The ultimate goal of this project is to perform a detailed comparison of wine and spirits sales on iDealwine. Specifically:

- Identify the relationships between price and product characteristics (color, region, etc.).
- Analyze the performance of different sales types (auctions vs e-store).
- Determine which product categories sell best and at what price.

### Technologies Used
- Python: for web scraping (using BeautifulSoup/Scrapy).
- Visualization tools: Excel, PowerBI.
- VSC (Visual Studio Code): for coding.
- PowerPoint : For the presentation of my work

### Project Structure
- Data Scraping: extracting wine and spirits information.

- Statistical Analysis: exploring relationships between variables.
- Visualization of Results: creating charts and extracting insights.

### Expected Outcomes
